    <h1>History of Little Birch Lake</h1>

     <blockquote>We are interested in compiling a history of Little Birch Lake-
       if you have anything to add, please
       <a href="mailto:dweirens@webgurudesign.com?subject=LBLIA - History info">

       <br>
       We know that on November 23, 1896, at 3:00 pm there was a signing of a charter for an association named &#8220;Birch Lake Outing Club&#8221;.
       Its general purpose and plan of operation was to purchase and hold real
       estate on Birch Lake, located in both Stearns and Todd Counties.<br />

       <br />

       Those involved were businessmen from Sauk Centre: &nbsp;Mr. J.W. Ward, Mr. E Richards, Mr. C.M. Sprague, Mr. R.T. Greene, Mr. J.M. McMasters, Mr. W.O.P. Hilladale, Mr. M.E. Kelsey, Mr. F. Cooper, and Mr. C. Thomas.<br />

       <br />

       Mr. J.W. Ward and Mr. E. Richards purchased land and built cottages for people to stay in during the spring and summer.  Each one rented out cabins at that time.  They had 6 or 8 cabins to rent.  Mr. C. Thomas, Mr. F. Cooper, Mr. M.E.
       Kelsey and others bought property and built cabins for their own use.<br />

       <br />

       The

       Ward Springs store was started sometime during the early 1900&#8217;s.  The train ran through Ward Springs going from Morris, MN and ending in Little Falls, MN.  The Hoppe&#8217;s eventually bought the store providing a close grocery store to the lake, and a mail stop for the train.  They also sold minnows and other fishing supplies, including fishing licenses.  Later, they added a back area where they had a pool table and sold pop and beer.
       The Ward Springs Store was always a favorite for the kids who would walk there from the cabin to enjoy a cold ice cream treat, popsicle or some candy. &nbsp;<br />

       <br />

       Mr. J.W. Ward and Mr. E. Richards built a dirt road for people to use to
       get to their cabins. This road was always known as &#8220;Shady Lane&#8220;.<br />

       <br />

       This is just the start of the history of Little Birch Lake.  The Little Birch Lake Association would like to publish a book on the history of Little Birch Lake
       at some point.  Please send Doris Sackett [2018 Garden Ave, Falcon Heights, MN 55113], or email her at <U><a href="mailto:skslsl@earthlink.net">skslsl@earthlink.net</a></U> any background/historical &nbsp;information, stories,  or pictures that you may have about the history of Little Birch Lake.  We do have someone that will put all the material together for the book.<br />

       <br />

       Thank You in advance for your help in the making of &#8220;The History of Little Birch Lake&quot; come to life.</blockquote>
